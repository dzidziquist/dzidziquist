“I have come to understand and appreciate that data is powerful. Let’s change the world with data.”

👩🏽‍💻 Hi there, I am Dzifa. Thank you for taking the time to be here 😊. I am a data enthusiast and I am on this amazing journey to explore data, learn more and visualize for insight. Having a bachelor’s degree in Economics and statistics and on the path of data science, I am excited to share this journey with you. 

Being an MSc Data Science student currently, I find myself learning other tools such as Analytical tools since I have found a new love in data visualization and storytelling.
